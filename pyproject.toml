description = "A PySelfMongo client for the [MongoDB][mongo] database is a thin client that connects to a mongo server and provides a simple interface to the database. A client is written as a singleton to make sure that only one connection is open at a time. The connection timeout is taken care by checking the server info every time a request is made. A new connection is made if the server info is not available or the connection has timed out."
